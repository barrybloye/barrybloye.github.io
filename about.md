I am a Front-end Web Developer with over 13 years' professional experience (as of 2016). I'm based in Lewes, which is just outside of Brighton in Sussex.

My specialism is the accurate translation of designs from static comps in to responsive, accessible, search-engine friendly websites using established and new web standards.
